        <h1>World's COVID Vaccinations</h1>
    </section>
    
    <section id="intro">
        <p class="para">To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to the virus. 
            The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. Vaccines are a technology that humanity has often relied 
            on in the past to bring down the death toll of infectious diseases. It has been 2 years since the first
            pandemic, let's have a look at the progress of implementing protection against COVID and the impact of it
            to the world. </p>

        <div id="vacc_map"></div>
        <p class="para">It can be seen that countries with high population require a greater number of Vaccines
            to achieve herd immunity. <b>China</b> and <b>India</b> are great examples, following up with other Asian 
            countries and in American region. However, it is considerable that several countries have yet able to have 
            any access to vaccinations during the time frame of analytics. </p>

        <h2 class="sub_heading">Vaccination vs COVID Cases</h2>
        <p class="para">Most countries and regions have a relative fair ratio between the number of confirmed COVID
            cases with the number of vaccinations conducted. On the one hand, <b>Haiti</b> stands out with and oddly high
            number of cases recorded with minor vaccine accessed. Following up are <b>United State</b> and <b>United Kingdom</b> 
            with considerable number of COVID cases while also joining <b>Asian</b> countries in the <b>top consumption</b> of
            vaccinations.</p>

                <p class="para">It is clear that <b>Oxford/AstraZeneca</b> and <b>Sinovac</b> are Manufacturers that account for a 
                    significant number of vaccines. <b>Moderna</b> and <b>Sinopharm</b> are less common with only around 10% nominated 
                    as vaccine of choice, while the remaining brands consisting of <b>Pfizer/BioNTech</b>, <b>SputnikV</b> 
                    and <b>Johnson&Johnson</b> only contributed to a minor percentage of approximately 15% total of Global vaccine distribution.
